# Credit-Card-Customer-Churn-Analysis
A Predictive Analysis on Credit Customer Churn Using Machine Learning and Ensemble Techniques. The aim of this research is to develop and compare predictive models to detect credit card customer attrition in order to better help financial institutions reduce the severity of loss to their businesses incurred by customers exiting the company. Machine Learning techniques such as Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, K-Nearest Neighbours, XGBoost and Artificial Neural Networks, as well as Ensemble techniques such as Stacking using Logistic Regression as a meta-learner and Voting are leveraged to classify credit card customer churn.
